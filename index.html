 <h1>About Me</h1>  
 <section>
  <section id=Introduction>
 <p>My name is Aza Brungardt! I am a parent to 3 kiddos and live in
    Ogden with my partner. I used to teach high school ceramics
    but had to quit teaching due to a disability. I'm interested in
    learning to code because I think there will be a lot of opportunities
    for me to apply my creative skills towards a new line of work.
