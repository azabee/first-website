    <h1>Travel</h1>
    <p>Throughout the years, I have been lucky enough to be able to travel for work, schooling,
    as well as for pleasure. Some of my abroad trips have included an educational tour of Scandinavia (Sweden,
    Finland, and Estonia) to research teaching styles and differences between the US and Scandindavia.
    Additionally, I have been able to research historic and contemporary art in Italy and Greece and have 
    travelled throughout the southwest with my family for pleasure. My daughter in particular is very interested
    in paleontology and geology, so we have travelled to a lot of locations to see fossils, dig for minerals, 
    or learn more about the cultures of the area through the petroglyphs left behind.
